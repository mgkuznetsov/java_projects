/**
 * For synchronized statements, the input is an object, and that's what we lock onto
 * Advantage over synchronized methods is:
 * 1. Synchronized code is as small as possible - don't need a full method
 * 2. We don't synchronize on the object itself, so we can use any object to synchronize
 * 3. We can do processing and know that some other thread isn't simultaneously modifying the value
