/**
 * Threads cooperate through locks
 * Acquiring lock prevents other threads to acquire the lock until the holder releases it
 * Locks can be acquired and released through "synchronized" objects
 * Locks are given on a per thread basis - a thread can call multiple synchronized methods once it
 * gets a lock on object. This allows for calling recursive methods.
 * We need both getters and setters to be synchronized because if at Thread calls both methods to 
 * update the bank account, then we must be sure no other threads are accessing the bank account at 
 * the same time.
