/**
 * Threads cooperate through locks
 * Acquiring lock prevents other threads to acquire the lock until the holder releases it
 * Locks can be acquired and released through "synchronized" objects
 * Locks are given on a per thread basis - a thread can call multiple synchronized methods once it
 * gets a lock on object. This allows for calling recursive methods.
